This script is useful in case of multiple host configuration in terms of static IP, and hostname.

It reads the specified fields in the config.json file and accordingly rewrite these files:

/etc/network/interfaces

/etc/hosts

/etc/hostname

This is time saving in case you have to configure hosts with an id and a static IP address.

It retreives automatically the name of the ethernet interface.
